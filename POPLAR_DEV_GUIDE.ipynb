    "# Exploring Poplar on Paperspace\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the instructions on how to experiment with the Graphcore's C++ graph programming API Poplar in a notebook environment. Although not designed for C++ development notebooks can be made to work and are a quick way to understand Poplar development.\n",

    "### Starting/stopping Paperspace machines\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a Paperspace gradient notebook it is in a dormant state. Launch an IPU machine by hitting the 'start machine' button at the top of the page. If you do not have a Paperspace account you will be prompted to create one before the machine launches:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Start machine screenshot](images/start_machine_poplar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The instructions below will switch you to a classic Jupyter lab view of the notebook. When you are done don't forget to stop the machine by returning to the Paperspace gradient notebook and hitting the stop button at the top. You can always return monitor your active machines and notebooks via your Paperspace account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run a simple program\n",
    "\n",
    "First lets just run a Poplar program directly in the notebook. Some useful repositories were checked out for you when setting up this notebook instance. Running the following cell will pull the Graphcore tutorials repo to make sure it is up to date and then build and run the first Poplar tutorial:"
